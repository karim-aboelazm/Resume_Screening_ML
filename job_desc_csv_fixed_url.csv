https://www.themuse.com/jobs/accenture/emerging-technology-software-innovation-consultant,"Most software developers, engineers, and architects get to build cool software systems. Very few get to say with a straight face: ""I'm reinventing banking."" Or hospitality, or logistics, or insurance. We're combining technology, industry expertise, and entrepreneurial experience to massively disrupt our clients' core businesses, in order to propel them into the future and create better products and experiences for everyone.

We're doing this by leveraging the power of new patterns and architectures (Serverless, Microservices, Event Sourcing, etc) and technologies (Kafka, Elixir, TensorFlow, Node.js, Docker, Go) to build cloud-native style solutions for the enterprise. Most of our work fits what we call Digital Decoupling, where we design and build a state of the art system to wrap legacy, isolate legacy components, build new functionality, and slowly and methodically hollow out the existing core.

Our team is deeply hands on, highly technical, and prides itself in being battle hardened, lead-from-the-front technology thought leaders. If you want to largely draw diagrams and pontificate on adding yet another layer to an already bloated monolith, this probably isn't the role for you. Our competitors are hiring for that kind of thing.

If, however, you're interested in solving some of the hardest problems in enterprise technology and transforming and disrupting established industries, let's talk.

+ Basic qualifications

Basic Qualifications:

Minimum 2 years hands on experience building interesting and innovative applications, or equivalent open source contribution (several projects as ongoing contributor).
While we are looking for a mix of technologies, .NET or JEE application experience or legacy application maintenance probably don't qualify as interesting or innovative.
Experience explaining complex technical concepts to an executive audience. If you can explain what event sourcing or the reactor pattern are to a layperson, you've got this.
Some experience designing and building software systems. i.e planning out infrastructure, cloud platform components, network details etc.
Experience working in an agile team.


Technical Literacy (Required for all levels):

Working knowledge of git
Experience with at least one modern programming language (including but not limited to Go, JavaScript, Elixir, Ruby, Python, Rust, and sometimes Java)


Preferred Qualifications (General):

Below are 'nice to haves', and if you don't have more than one or two, don't be discouraged. We're trying to build a team with a very diverse set of skills and backgrounds, and a big part of that means different skills.

Experience with more than one programming language (JavaScript, Go, Elixir, Python, or Rust preferred)
Hands on experience with Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud Platform, or Azure; namely choosing platform components and assembling application and runtime architecture
Experience with the Serverless framework and serverless architecture.
Experience with microservices architectures and constituent technologies (hapijs, gokit, Spring Cloud)
Experience with containerization and container platforms. (e.g. Docker, Kubernetes, Docker EE, Mesosphere)'
Experience with Event Driven Architectures and constituent technologies (e.g. Kafka, Kinesis) and patterns (Event Sourcing, etc)
Functional programming experience, specifically with Actor systems (Erlang, Elixir, Akka)
Experience with embedded devices and development (mostly C, but also some Rust, etc)
Experience with high performance networking (Quic, network layer optimization) or realtime transaction protocols/methods (HTTP2, Server Sent Events, MQTT, WebSockets)
Experience with distributed transactional data stores (CockroachDB, Spanner, ScyllaDB, etc)",JavaScript,Seattle

https://www.themuse.com/jobs/accenture/emerging-technology-software-innovation-manager,"Most software developers, engineers, and architects get to build cool software systems. Very few get to say with a straight face: ""I'm reinventing banking."" Or hospitality, or logistics, or insurance. We're combining technology, industry expertise, and entrepreneurial experience to massively disrupt our clients' core businesses, in order to propel them into the future and create better products and experiences for everyone.

We're doing this by leveraging the power of new patterns and architectures (Serverless, Microservices, Event Sourcing, etc) and technologies (Kafka, Elixir, TensorFlow, Node.js, Docker, Go) to build cloud-native style solutions for the enterprise. Most of our work fits what we call Digital Decoupling, where we design and build a state of the art system to wrap legacy, isolate legacy components, build new functionality, and slowly and methodically hollow out the existing core.

Our team is deeply hands on, highly technical, and prides itself in being battle hardened, lead-from-the-front technology thought leaders. If you want to largely draw diagrams and pontificate on adding yet another layer to an already bloated monolith, this probably isn't the role for you. Our competitors are hiring for that kind of thing.

If, however, you're interested in solving some of the hardest problems in enterprise technology and transforming and disrupting established industries, let's talk.

+ Basic qualifications

Minimum 5 years' experience building interesting and innovative applications, or equivalent open source contribution (several projects as ongoing contributor). While we are looking for a mix of technologies, .NET or JEE application experience or legacy application maintenance probably don't qualify as interesting or innovative.
Experience explaining complex technical concepts to an executive audience. If you can explain what event sourcing or the reactor pattern are to a layperson, you've got this.
Minimum 3 years' experience designing and building software systems. i.e planning out infrastructure, cloud platform components, network details etc.
Experience leading a product team with several agile teams working toward a common goal. Experience designing and leading engineering systems and DevOps, i.e managing the process of building software.
Deep knowledge of one or more industry areas (e.g. Hospitality, Banking, Insurance, Film)


**Technical Literacy (Required for all levels) :
Working knowledge of git
Experience with at least one modern programming language (including but not limited to Go, JavaScript, Elixir, Ruby, Python, Rust, and sometimes Java) Preferred Qualifications (General): Below are 'nice to haves', and if you don't have more than one or two, don't be discouraged. We're trying to build a team with a very diverse set of skills and backgrounds, and a big part of that means different skills.


Preferred Qualifications (General):

Experience with more than one programming language (JavaScript, Go, Elixir, Python, or Rust preferred)
Hands on experience with Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud Platform, or Azure; namely choosing platform components and assembling application and runtime architecture
Experience with the Serverless framework and serverless architecture.
Experience with microservices architectures and constituent technologies (hapijs, gokit, Spring Cloud)
Experience with containerization and container platforms. (e.g. Docker, Kubernetes, Docker EE, Mesosphere)'
Experience with Event Driven Architectures and constituent technologies (e.g. Kafka, Kinesis) and patterns (Event Sourcing, etc)
Functional programming experience, specifically with Actor systems (Erlang, Elixir, Akka)
Experience with embedded devices and development (mostly C, but also some Rust, etc)
Experience with high performance networking (Quic, network layer optimization) or realtime transaction protocols/methods (HTTP2, Server Sent Events, MQTT, WebSockets)
Experience with distributed transactional data stores (CockroachDB, Spanner, ScyllaDB, etc)

We have a fun and casual office atmosphere, but everyone works diligently to get the job done. HRTers are motivated by the excitement of being at the forefront of the automated trading world. No politics or red tape impede the generation or implementation of ideas.",Python,New York City
https://www.themuse.com/jobs/hudsonrivertrading/algo-software-engineer-cpython,"At HRT, we program computers to intelligently trade on the stock market. We make the world’s markets more financially efficient using smart algorithms. To get the job done, we hire some of the smartest computer scientists in the world to develop both our low latency trading platform and our massive distributed research platform.
Algo Software Engineers (AE) are programmers that are embedded in HRT’s trading teams and work hand-in-hand with Algo Strategy Developers (AD). Whereas ADs tend to use their math skills to make smarter strategies, AEs focus on the software that powers trading and research. Because of this close collaboration, AEs tend to be the type of engineers that thrive on constant interaction and discussion. Hearing how their most recently deployed system allowed for whole new types of research would make their week. AEs are the type of engineers that don’t mind juggling a few projects at once and have a varied portfolio of project types, from long-term ambitious new systems to fire-fighting live issues.
Our environment is particularly well suited to driven, self-motivated programmers. For one, the company’s Partners are all programmers. Team Leads spend a majority of their time doing technical work. Algo teams run on a very bottom-up approach that encourages everyone on the teams to come up with ideas and dictate the direction of each team together. Finally, there is very little emphasis placed on project management process (almost no meetings and no project managers) and there is a lot of emphasis placed on engineering process such as automated testing, design/code reviews, and technical training.
We are a Linux/Unix shop with a codebase written primarily in C++ and Python. If you are not a C++ or Python or Linux expert, that’s probably OK. We really care more about your technical fundamentals, practical experience and that intense desire to make things better for other people. That being said, we want someone who is familiar with a non-scripting language such as C++ or Java.
Here are a few examples of programmers who are currently AEs at HRT:
Leo came to HRT immediately after graduating from the Cornell CS department. He enjoyed the low-level details of Operating Systems as well as the theory of Algorithms and was open to learning new technologies and languages on the fly. He had an affinity for building fast, efficient, and scalable systems and tinkered with C++ and Rust in his own time. In group projects, peers at school would single him out for his technical strength, work ethic, and positive attitude.
When he’s not solving riddles and dancing salsa, David’s writing distributed computing APIs. He regularly solves bugs like “one out of a million jobs are dying on only these machines and only on Tuesdays”. He likes bridging the gap between Algo Strategy Developers and Systems Engineers to explore how to use distributed computing to run research. He really enjoys coming up with ways to make millions of jobs more efficient.
Kai came to HRT after 3.5 years of programming C++ at a company that provides large amounts of data to the finance industry. He plays several musical instruments and has tasted thousands of wines, yet he finds his work to be an even more rewarding experience. He builds tools to discover opportunities and aid live trading. He is excited about automating strategies and implementing ideas from his teammates, in addition to applying his technical skills to the world of trading.
Aaron started programming at age 5 and previously ran the research team at a music software company, bringing over 7 years of experience to HRT. He cooks and practices partner acrobatics in his free time. He gets joy from his teammates’ happiness when their research runs twice as fast, from building them tools that help them visualize their strategies, and from keeping code organized and maintainable. He's gotten coworkers from other teams involved in latency improvements to his group's live trading. He enjoys the collaborative environment and learning from his coworkers.

https://www.themuse.com/jobs/accenture/emerging-technology-software-innovation-consultant,"Most software developers, engineers, and architects get to build cool software systems. Very few get to say with a straight face: ""I'm reinventing banking."" Or hospitality, or logistics, or insurance. We're combining technology, industry expertise, and entrepreneurial experience to massively disrupt our clients' core businesses, in order to propel them into the future and create better products and experiences for everyone.

We're doing this by leveraging the power of new patterns and architectures (Serverless, Microservices, Event Sourcing, etc) and technologies (Kafka, Elixir, TensorFlow, Node.js, Docker, Go) to build cloud-native style solutions for the enterprise. Most of our work fits what we call Digital Decoupling, where we design and build a state of the art system to wrap legacy, isolate legacy components, build new functionality, and slowly and methodically hollow out the existing core.

Our team is deeply hands on, highly technical, and prides itself in being battle hardened, lead-from-the-front technology thought leaders. If you want to largely draw diagrams and pontificate on adding yet another layer to an already bloated monolith, this probably isn't the role for you. Our competitors are hiring for that kind of thing.

Some experience designing and building software systems. i.e planning out infrastructure, cloud platform components, network details etc.
Experience working in an agile team.


Technical Literacy (Required for all levels):

Working knowledge of git
Experience with at least one modern programming language (including but not limited to Go, JavaScript, Elixir, Ruby, Python, Rust, and sometimes Java)


Preferred Qualifications (General):

Below are 'nice to haves', and if you don't have more than one or two, don't be discouraged. We're trying to build a team with a very diverse set of skills and backgrounds, and a big part of that means different skills.

When we launched as a startup we disrupted the credit card industry by individually personalizing every credit card offer using statistical modeling and the relational database, cutting edge technology in 1988! Fast-forward a few years, and this little innovation and our passion for data has skyrocketed us to a Fortune 200 company and a leader in the world of data-driven decision-making.

As a Data Scientist at Capital One, you'll be part of a team that's leading the next wave of disruption at a whole new scale, using the latest in distributed computing technologies and operating across billions and billions of customer transactions to unlock the big opportunities that help everyday people save money, time and agony in their financial lives.

On any given day you'll be:

-Using Big Data tools (Hadoop, Spark, H2O, AWS) to conduct the analysis of billions of customer transaction records

-Writing software to clean and investigate large, messy data sets of numerical and textual data

-Integrating with external data sources and APIs to discover interesting trends

-Building machine learning models from development through testing and validation to our 30+ million customers in production

-Designing rich data visualizations to communicate complex ideas to customers or company leaders

-Investigating the impact of new technologies on the future of digital banking and the financial world of tomorrow

The Ideal Candidate will be:

-Curious. You ask why, you explore, you're not afraid to blurt out your disruptive idea. You probably know Python, Scala, or R and you're constantly exploring new open source tools.

-Wrangler. You know how to programmatically extract data from a database and an API, bring it through a transformation or two, and model it into human-readable form (ROC curve, map, d3 visualization, Tableau, etc.).

-Creative. Big, undefined problems and petabytes of data don't frighten you. You're used to working with abstract data, and you love discovering new narratives in unmined territories.

Twenty-five years after Capital One was started it's still led by its founder. Be ready to join a community of the smartest people you've ever met, who see the customer first, and want to use their data skills to make a difference.

Lever is rapidly growing, and with that growth comes the additional need to provide our customers -- and potential customers -- with robust information regarding integrations, security, infrastructure, account configuration, and customization.

Our Sales Engineer will bring the technical prowess needed to close new customers and support our team of Account Executives in the sales process. You should have previous experience supporting a scaling organization through a deep product knowledge while still carrying a quota (and assist your fellow sales people to attain theirs). While learning the ins and outs of Lever, you will provide insights and recommend new language for describing Lever’s value to prospective customers. We’ll count on you to be able to pick up new tools quickly, as you’ll need to be a product expert. You’ll be working directly with prospective customers every day, and be on the phone nearly as much as you’re preparing your arsenal of technical know-how.

We go to great lengths to ensure that every one of our prospective and current customers has a great experience working with our team, and you’ll be a core part of that. You should have a penchant for customer empathy -- you’ll be working closely with customers to identify their needs and pain points. You will learn how to overcome common objections and provide the answers to integration and customization questions. You’ve ideally worked to sell a SaaS product, but even if you haven’t, you’ll learn a lot as you onboard and dive in.

At Lever, it is each team’s responsibility to set the next team up for success when interacting with customers, and your role will prove to be no different. You will help create trust with customers and enable Account Executives or Customer Success Managers to do the same. Lever is interested in the long game, and we believe it all comes down to building long-lasting, meaningful relationships with our customers. That starts with you.

Join four in-depth product training sessions to learn the inner workings of Lever’s talent acquisition suite and pre-built integrations; pass a series of exams to become a certified product expert
Learn Lever’s go-to-market messaging, key differentiators, and segment-specific value propositions: participate in the same sales training program as Mid-Market Account Executives, shadow three customer-facing meetings with each Account Executive you support
Complete sales certification; deliver a mock pitch and product demonstration to a group of Account Executives and sales leaders, qualifying you to work on full-cycle deals

WITHIN 3 MONTHS, YOU'LL:
Deliver product demonstrations and technical presentations to potential customers, leading to your first closed won deal
Participate in two advanced technical training courses: infrastructure, security controls, and certifications; complete a practice questionnaire (reviewed by your manager) to ensure you can answer comprehensive security and compliance questions; and API and potential applications, including custom careers pages, HR system integrations, business intelligence systems, and event monitoring; architect and build a custom solution to complete a final capstone project
Become a strategic partner to Mid-Market Sales, achieve your individual new bookings goal, and help the team hit their quarterly revenue goals

WITHIN 6 MONTHS, YOU'LL:
Continue to partner with Mid-Market Sales, reach an even higher individual bookings goal, and increase new business win rates by:
Leading in person product demonstrations that showcase how Lever solves modern recruiting challenges
Meeting with IT and security professionals to handle technical objections and mitigate any concerns that might block a deal
Designing custom solutions and proof-of-concepts that illustrate how Lever augments the systems and processes our customers already have in place

Identify, implement, and document process improvements; tackle projects that contribute the continued success of the Sales Engineering organization
Master Mid-Market sales engineering, choosing to develop your teammates in that segment or move up market and begin working Enterprise deals

This means Sunrun owns, maintains, and monitors the system while homeowners pay for the electricity it produces.

About Uber
We're changing the way people think about transportation. Not that long ago we were just an app to request premium black cars in a few metropolitan areas. Now we're a part of the logistical fabric of more than 600 cities around the world. Whether it's a ride, a sandwich, or a package, we use technology to give people what they want, when they want it.
For the people who drive with Uber, our app represents a flexible new way to earn money. For cities, we help strengthen local economies, improve access to transportation, and make streets safer.
And that's just what we're doing today. We're thinking about the future, too. With teams working on autonomous trucking and self-driving cars, we're in for the long haul. We're reimagining how people and things move from one place to the next.

Strategy. Select which projects the team should prioritize, and set a timeline to reach goals quickly
Drive analysis on important strategic decisions in order to optimize our regional business
Working closely with other members of the Uber team, measure the impact and efficiency of new products and business processes
